# ROUTER 1X3 DESIGN

## Introduction
This repository serves the purpose of presenting the design of a 1X3 8 bit router. It contains the RTL desing, Simulation and Synthesis using softwares like Modelsim, Quartus prime, and Questasim. The language used for RTL code is Verilog.

## Construct
### FIFO
FIFO stands for First In First Out, it is a memory block in which the data entered first is the one which is taken out. In the router the main task of FIFO is to store the incoming packets from the source and acts as a buffer between source an destination. It also helps to transfer data from source to destination both working at different data transfer rate.
